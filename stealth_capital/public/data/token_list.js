            <br /><br />
            Accepting the fact that the world might not develop in the way that anyone had expected is a difficult but necessary element of investment life. By acknowledging this fact, and taking into account the uncertainty when executing the investment strategies, the Company aim for generating an attractive, long-term risk adjusted return.
