            suddenly become realizable, hence providing a great
            potential for Axio.<br /><br />
            Axio will invest in NASDAQ 100 and S&P and top 100
            Europen stocks and top 10 HONG KONG STOCKS.

            <br /><br />
            The bonds are in general chosen with respect to maturity and market liquidity – and always only officially rated bonds, while the properties are chosen with respect to location and return.
            <br /><br />
            Accepting the fact that the world might not develop in the way that anyone had expected is a difficult but necessary element of investment life. By acknowledging this fact, and taking into account the uncertainty when executing the investment strategies, the Company aim for generating an attractive, long-term risk adjusted return.
